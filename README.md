# UMD AI Website

A Website created for the UMD AI Club using Bootstrap framework

It has been a year since our club has been formed (we were born in Fall 2017), and we needed a website just like the other CS Clubs at UMD. 
As the webmaster, I was given the task of building a simple, front-end design to showcase our current projects, resources, and mission
statements. I chose the Bootstrap framework for its simplicity and elegancy.

I will continue to work on updates for the website (hopefully, in the future, as our club grows, we will implement a more robust framework).
This website conforms to Web Consortium Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 level AA standards, as per UMD DIT request.
